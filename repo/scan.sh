# We can't allow $where to leak into Sources and Packages, because those paths
# will not be correct inside the chroot.  Inside the chroot $where gets
# mounted onto $chroot_where.  In the Packages file, this leaks into the
# Filename: line, and in the Sources file, it leaks into the Directory: line.
#
# I'll bet there's an apt-ftparchive -o option to control these,
# (e.g. ArchiveDir and PathPrefix), but I am an idiot and cannot get it to
# work.  Thus, these ugly hacks.  If you have a more elegant solution, email
# me!  barry@ubuntu.com
